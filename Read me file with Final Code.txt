----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some issues with this code and I unfortunately realised this too late. 
Anyway I would like to explain why this is happening:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - For the year 2016 the ticker AAC came up with its values wrong.
This is because of my "Workingdays" variable, I wrongly assumed all tickers had
the same trade days within a year. The ticker AAC just had data from October so my code 
didn't work there. I would need an indented loop with i and j and with conditional to cover such cases. 
The number of working days are equal to the first ticker of each year.  

2 - I possibly overcomplicated my code, it runs well in smaller files and test file. It seems to take ages 
for the master file so I had to reduce considerably this file to ran the macros with a single click. 
There might be inconsistencies in Max and Min because it's calculating from a reduced sample of tickers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The codes are below: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I separated in 3 different macros below:
- Ticker generator
- Max Min calculator
- Formatting
